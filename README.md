* Responsive Design
* Social sharing of individual todos (Twitter only)
* "Duplicate" icon on each todo (to duplciate items)
* Trash - when items are cleared or removed, they go to a trash
  * The trash is an additional backbone collection and view (and localstorage) that holds items until they are
  * permanently removed.
  * Items in the trash can be "restored" or "removed permanently"
  * There is a button to clear all.
